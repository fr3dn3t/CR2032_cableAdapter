# CR2032_cableAdapter

As I was tired to always change batteries when debugging on CR2032 powered boards I quickly designed a proper adapter to connect a CR2032 slot to a lab power supply. 
<br /><br />To build some of the adapters yourself you can download the gerbers here: <br />https://github.com/fr3dn3t/CR2032_cableAdapter/blob/master/ECAD/CR2032_cableAdapter/Project%20Outputs%20for%20CR2032_cableAdapter/gerber.zip
<br /> Order the PCBs to be 1.6mm thick so you get the 3.2mm thickness of a CR2032 when you stack two PCBs on top of each other and glue them together.
