# CR2032_cableAdapter

As I was tired to always change batteries when debugging on CR2032 powered boards I quickly designed a proper adapter to connect a CR2032 slot to a lab power supply. 
<br /><br />To build some of the adapters yourself you can download the gerbers here: <br />https://github.com/fr3dn3t/CR2032_cableAdapter/blob/master/ECAD/CR2032_cableAdapter/Project%20Outputs%20for%20CR2032_cableAdapter/gerber.zip
<br /> Order the PCBs to be 1.6mm thick so you get the 3.2mm thickness of a CR2032 when you stack two PCBs on top of each other and glue them together. The design should also work for CR2016, just order 0.8mm thick PCBs instead of the 1.6mm ones.
